summary: Eclipse Mosquitto MQTT broker
description: This is a message broker that supports version 3.1 and 3.1.1 of the MQTT
    protocol.
    MQTT provides a method of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe
    model. It is lightweight, both in terms of bandwidth usage and ease of
    implementation. This makes it particularly useful at the edge of the network
    where a sensor or other simple device may be implemented using an arduino for
    example.
